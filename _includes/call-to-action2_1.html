                    We integrated Now Corpus with another dataset, Factbook.
                    It has facts groupped per year however the data is
                    not coherrent and consistent, eg population record exist
                    for 2016 for some countires while 2014,2015,2016 for others.
                    Since we intented to compare countries with each other in terms
                    of news topics, we chose where we had the most consistent
                    records on the Factbook, which is 2016.

                    <br> <br>
                    Graph on the left shows how many article/news collected per country of interest
                    per month.
