                    The NOW Corpus (News on the Web) is composed of 6,979,691,862 billion words of data,
                    and it is now growing by 160-170 million words per month, or about 1.6 billion words per year).
                    <br> <br>
                    In order to create the corpus, scripts run every hour to get URLs for new magazine and newspaper articles
                    from Google News, for about 9,000-10,000 new texts each day. Downloaded texts are cleaned by JusText
                    (to remove boilerplate material); tagged and lemmatized; and then integrated into existing relational database.
                    <br> <br>
                    The dataset we have in the cluster is for 6 years from 2010-2016(until October) of 20 different English speaking countries.
