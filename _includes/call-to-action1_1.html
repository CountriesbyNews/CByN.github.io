               In the topic distribution map we showed the most published topic in each country for each month.
               From the Topic Distribution Map for each Country over time we observed that
overall, the most frequently published articles for each country doesn't change very often.
This can show in which topics are countries are mostly talking based on the data we have.
 Some examples, could be USA and India talking Politics most whereas for Australia the topics
  diverge between Economy, Tech and Entertainment/Art/Magazine and they mostly talk Economy in
  the beginning of the year whereas they tend to publish more on Tech/Science articles in the second term of the year.
For some countries the most published topics in every month doesn't change over time.
For example, in South Africa we see that Sports is always the most published topic for 2016.
Note: One thing to consider is that if the number of unique web resources that the data collected for
a country is limited and it is a web resource on a specific topic, the most frequent topics may seem
not to be changing. This might be the case for South Africa since it has lower number of unique resources
 and if these resources also publishes only on specific topics.
