                    We integrated Now Corpus with another dataset, Factbook.
                    It has facts groupped per year however the data is
                    not coherrent and consistent. 
                    Since we intented to compare countries with each other in terms
                    of news topics, we chose where we had the most consistent
                    records on the Factbook, which is 2016.

                    Graph on the left shows how many article/news collected per country of interest
                    per month.We can observe several things:
                    Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana has very few articles all the time compared
                        to other countries such as Canada, USA, Great Britain and India.
                        We can see from here as well that our data is not equally distributed
                        neither within months nor overall. It is important to keep in mind that
                        for some countries, since the data is limited the interpretations made
                         here could be misleading compared to the actual news media.
                         According to our data the article counts are fewer (paler colors)
                       in the winter season in the overall most countries.
